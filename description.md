# Jump Game Problem

## Requirements
You are given an integer array `nums` where you start at the first index (index 0). Each element in the array represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position.

Your goal is to determine if you can reach the last index of the array.

## Rules
- You start at index 0
- From index i, you can jump to any index from i+1 to i+nums[i] (inclusive)
- You need to reach index nums.length-1
- Return true if possible, false otherwise

## Edge Cases
1. **Single element array**: Always return true (you're already at the last index)
2. **Zero at start**: If nums[0] = 0 and array length > 1, return false
3. **Zeros in middle**: Can be jumped over if you have enough reach
4. **Exact reach**: Can reach exactly the last index
5. **Stuck scenarios**: When you reach a position with 0 jump length before the end

## Constraints
- Array length: 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10⁴
- Element values: 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁵
- All elements are non-negative integers
